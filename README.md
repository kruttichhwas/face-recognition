#Exploring Image Classification & Facial Recognition Techniques
##Introduction
In this project, we explore various techniques for image classification and facial recognition. Specifically, we delve into the comparison of Linear Binary Pattern (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) features.

##Dataset
We utilized the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset, which consists of facial images of different individuals. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure a minimum number of faces per person for reliable analysis.

###Dataset Analysis
Number of images: 1288
Image size: 50 x 37
Number of unique classes: 7
Target class names: [List of target names]

##Feature Extraction Techniques
###Linear Binary Pattern (LBP)
-Implemented from scratch and using skimage library
-Visualized LBP features and compared with original images
-Utilized LBP features for classification
###Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG)
-Resized images to 64 x 128 for consistency
-Detected vertical and horizontal gradients
-Calculated magnitudes and angles of gradients
-Extracted HoG features and visualized them
-Applied HoG features for classification
###Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
-Designed a simple CNN architecture using Keras
-Trained the CNN model on the dataset
-Visualized activations of the CNN layers
-Extracted CNN features and employed them for classification
##Classification
We performed classification using different classifiers on features extracted by LBP, HoG, and CNN.
